        <h1>Arshad's favorite lyrics: </h1>
        
        <p>All along it was a fever
    A cold sweat, hot headed believer
    I threw my hands in the air I said show me something
    He said, if you dare come a little closer

    Round and around and around and around we go
    Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me now you know

    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    I want you to stay

    It's not much of a life you're living
    It's not just something you take, it's given
    Round and around, and around, and around we go
    Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me, now you know

    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    I want you to stay

    Oh the reason I hold on
    Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
    Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
    'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving

    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    I want you to stay, stay</p>

    <h1>Dmitry's favorite lyrics</h1>
    <p>     The beauty memories of all the places
            Of all the places
            We've captured with our camera
            We've seen the pyramids
            We've seen the Louvre
            We've seen the Orion upside down
            Total eclipses and moonlight shadows
            We've seen dolphins jumping waves
            We've ski'ed the mountains and we swam in the rivers
            And let the sunlight dry our skins
            But freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
            Freedom is the mastery of the known
            Freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
            No view is wider than the eye
            Show a view to someone who chose to live his whole life in cave
            He'll raise his arms to protect his eyes from burning
            And the blindness to which he belongs
            This time it's me, it's me
            Cascades of chances I'll just let them be
            The unfamiliar is right below our eyes
            Don't look for what we know
            The unfamiliar is right below our eyes
            But freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
            Freedom is the mastery of the known
            Freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
            No view is wider than the eye</p>

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay

<h1> Davids Lyrics</h1>
<h2>Be Still - The Killers</h2>
<p>
  Be still
  And go on to bed
  Nobody knows what lies ahead
  And life is short
  To say the least
  We're in the belly of the beast
  Be still
  Wild and young
  Long may your innocence reign
  Like shells on the shore
  And may your limits be unknown
  And may your efforts be your own
  If you ever feel you can't take it anymore
  Don't break character
  You've got a lot of heart
  Is this real or just a dream?
  Rise up like the sun
  Labor till the work is done
  Be still
  One day you'll leave
  Fearlessness on your sleeve
  When you've come back, tell me what did you see
  What did you see (what did you see)
  Was there something out there for me?
  Be still
  Close your eyes
  Soon enough you'll be on your own
  Steady and straight
  And if they drag you through the mud
  It doesn't change what's in your blood
  (Over chains, over chains, over ?, over ?)
  When they knock you down
  Don't break character
  You've got a lot of heart
  Is this real or just a dream?
  Be still
  Be still
  Be still
  Be still
  Over rock and chain
  Over sunset plain
  Over trap and snare
  When you're in too deep
  In your wildest dream
  In your made up scheme
  When they knock you down
  When they knock you down
  Don't break character
  You've got so much heart
  Is this real or just a dream?
  Oh Rise up like the sun
  And labor till the work is
  Rise up like the sun
  Labor till the work is done
</p>
<h1>Ben's lyrics</h1>
<p>I am a sniper
  Always hit the mark
  Paid assassin
  Working after dark
  Looking through the night
  Using infra-red
  My target on you
  Aimed at your head
  $10, 000 up front
  $10, 000 when I'm through
  And I know just what to do
  And ya know I'll do it too
  Then I'm coming back for you
  Back for you!
  I do the "getting rid of"
  Don't tell me why
  Don't need to hear the truth
  Don't need the lies
  Now pay me quickly
  And now we're through
  It brings me great pleasure
  To say my next job is you
  Don't you know that
  Killing is my business
  And business is good
  And business is good
  You'd better believe it</p>
