        <h1>Arshad's favorite lyrics: </h1>
        
        <p>All along it was a fever
    A cold sweat, hot headed believer
    I threw my hands in the air I said show me something
    He said, if you dare come a little closer

    Round and around and around and around we go
    Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me now you know

    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    I want you to stay

    It's not much of a life you're living
    It's not just something you take, it's given
    Round and around, and around, and around we go
    Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me, now you know

    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    I want you to stay

    Oh the reason I hold on
    Oh 'cause I need this hole gone
    Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
    'Cause when you never see the light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving

    Not really sure how to feel about it
    Something in the way you move
    Makes me feel like I can't live without you
    It takes me all the way
    I want you to stay, stay</p>

    <h1>Dmitry's favorite lyrics</h1>
    <p>     The beauty memories of all the places
            Of all the places
            We've captured with our camera
            We've seen the pyramids
            We've seen the Louvre
            We've seen the Orion upside down
            Total eclipses and moonlight shadows
            We've seen dolphins jumping waves
            We've ski'ed the mountains and we swam in the rivers
            And let the sunlight dry our skins
            But freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
            Freedom is the mastery of the known
            Freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
            No view is wider than the eye
            Show a view to someone who chose to live his whole life in cave
            He'll raise his arms to protect his eyes from burning
            And the blindness to which he belongs
            This time it's me, it's me
            Cascades of chances I'll just let them be
            The unfamiliar is right below our eyes
            Don't look for what we know
            The unfamiliar is right below our eyes
            But freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
            Freedom is the mastery of the known
            Freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
            No view is wider than the eye</p>
