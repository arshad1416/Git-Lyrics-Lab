  All along it was a fever A cold sweat, hot headed believer I threw my hands
  in the air I said show me something He said, if you dare come a little
  closer Round and around and around and around we go Oh now tell me, now tell
  me, now tell me now you know Not really sure how to feel about it Something
  in the way you move Makes me feel like I can't live without you It takes me
  all the way I want you to stay It's not much of a life you're living It's
  not just something you take, it's given Round and around, and around, and
  around we go Oh now tell me, now tell me, now tell me, now you know Not
  really sure how to feel about it Something in the way you move Makes me feel
  like I can't live without you It takes me all the way I want you to stay Oh
  the reason I hold on Oh 'cause I need this hole gone Funny you're the broken
  one but I'm the only one who needed saving 'Cause when you never see the
  light, it's hard to know which one of us is caving Not really sure how to
  feel about it Something in the way you move Makes me feel like I can't live
  without you It takes me all the way I want you to stay, stay

    I am a sniper Always hit the mark Paid assassin Working after dark Looking
    through the night Using infra-red My target on you Aimed at your head $10,
    000 up front $10, 000 when I'm through And I know just what to do And ya
    know I'll do it too Then I'm coming back for you Back for you! I do the
    "getting rid of" Don't tell me why Don't need to hear the truth Don't need
    the lies Now pay me quickly And now we're through It brings me great
    pleasure To say my next job is you Don't you know that Killing is my
    business And business is good And business is good You'd better believe it
